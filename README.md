# Spotify-Digital-Campaign-Insights


## The goal of this project is to investigate the performance of Spotify's digital marketing campaigns across all categories to surface recommendations for optimizing marketing budget allocation in future campaigns.

**Spotify, a leading music streaming service, has a vast user base across the globe.** To expand its user base further, Spotify has been running various digital marketing campaigns outside of its app since 2019. These campaigns span multiple platforms, including Email, SEO & SEM, and Social Media, and utilize various categories such as Welcome Series, Display Ads, Sponsored Posts, and more. Each category is designed to target potential users and encourage them to sign up for Spotify's services.

To stay competitive amidst evolving technology and shifting user preferences, Spotify aims to refine its marketing strategy by analyzing how different platforms and types impact user sign-ups and brand awareness. This project will offer insights into campaign effectiveness, aiding in more strategic budget allocation.

As Spotify strategizes its marketing budget for the upcoming year, a newly formed data team has been tasked with evaluating the success of past campaigns. The company’s primary objectives are twofold: 1) to significantly increase the number of new sign-ups, and 2) to enhance Spotify’s brand awareness globally.

## Summary of Insights


### Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- Across campaign categories, Carousel Ads achieved the highest CTR at 5.36%, despite having the lowest impressions. This exceptional performance was primarily driven by the Retention campaign type, which recorded an impressive CTR of 36.02%, significantly surpassing the overall average of 0.88%.
- Although Video Ads generated the highest impressions and sign-ups, they experienced a relatively low CTR of 0.71%. This was largely due to the Upsell, Educational, Retention, and Seasonal campaign types, which posted CTRs ranging from just 0.01% to 0.05%.
- Both Drip Campaigns and Sponsored Posts not only recorded the lowest CTRs but also had the lowest sign-up rates.

### Sign-Up Rate
- Across campaign categories, Carousel Ads and Influencer Partnership campaigns performed 5x and 2x better than the average sign-up rate, with rates of 0.048% and 0.016%, respectively.
- This high sign-up rate for Carousel Ads was attributed to the Retention campaign type, which by far had the highest sign-up rate across all campaign types (0.217%).
- Interestingly, despite having the highest sign-up rate and a relatively low cost per sign-up, Carousel Ads generated the fewest total sign-ups, with only 7,475.

### Cost per Sign-Up
- Across campaign categories, Welcome Series had the highest cost per sign-up at $5.14, coupled with a mediocre sign-up rate of 0.008% and highest sign-ups, compared to an average of $2.07.
- The elevated cost per sign-up for Welcome Series was driven by the Brand Awareness, Re-engagement, and Seasonal campaign types, with costs ranging from $7 to $10.
- Search Ads (Acquisition campaign type) and Display Ads (Content Promotion campaign type) also encountered notably high CACs, at $12.54 and $7.94, respectively. Search Ads in particular had the lowest sign-up rate at 0.005%.
 


## Recommendations & Next Step

- **Carousel Ads**: Allocate more budget to Carousel Ads within Retention campaign type to maximize ROI. Consider expanding their use to other campaign types where relevant.







Video Ads:

Drip Campaigns and Sponsored Posts: 

Welcome Series:   

Influencer Partnerships: 

Search Ads and Display Ads:

#### Prioritize Carousel Ads for Retention Campaigns:

- Carousel Ads have demonstrated exceptional performance with the highest CTR (5.36%) and a superior sign-up rate (0.048%). Despite generating fewer total sign-ups, their efficiency in converting impressions into sign-ups makes them an ideal format for Retention campaigns.
- Action: Allocate more budget to Carousel Ads within Retention campaigns to maximize ROI. Consider expanding their use to other campaign types where relevant.

#### Optimize Video Ads for Higher Engagement:

- Video Ads, while generating the highest impressions and sign-ups, suffer from a low CTR (0.71%). This suggests that while they reach a broad audience, their engagement is relatively weak.
- Action: Review the content and targeting strategy for Video Ads, especially for Upsell, Educational, Retention, and Seasonal campaigns, which showed particularly low CTRs. Experiment with different video lengths, messaging, and creative elements to boost engagement.


#### Reevaluate Drip Campaigns and Sponsored Posts:

- Both Drip Campaigns and Sponsored Posts have shown poor performance with the lowest CTRs and sign-up rates. Continuing to invest in these formats without substantial improvement may not be cost-effective.
- Action: Conduct A/B testing to explore alternative messaging and targeting strategies for these formats. If performance doesn’t improve, consider reallocating the budget to better-performing formats like Carousel Ads or Influencer Partnerships.

#### Reduce Cost per Sign-Up in Welcome Series Campaigns:

- The Welcome Series campaigns have the highest cost per sign-up at $5.14, with a moderate sign-up rate. While they generate a significant number of sign-ups, the cost is higher than average.
- Action: Optimize these campaigns by refining targeting criteria, reducing ad frequency, or improving creative elements to lower the cost per sign-up. Additionally, consider reallocating budget to more cost-effective campaigns, such as Carousel Ads.


#### Target Influencer Partnerships for Specific Campaign Types:

- Influencer Partnership campaigns perform well, with a sign-up rate double the average. However, they are underutilized in the overall strategy.
- Action: Expand the use of Influencer Partnerships, particularly for Acquisition and Brand Awareness campaigns, where their potential to engage and convert users can be maximized.


#### Review Underperforming Campaign Types:

- Campaign types like Search Ads - Acquisition and Display Ads - Content Promotion have extremely high CACs with low sign-up rates.
- Action: Investigate the targeting and content of these campaigns to identify the root causes of poor performance. Consider phasing out or significantly altering these campaign types if improvements cannot be made.
